This is a recreation of the Play-Yan, an obscure media player made for the GBA.

Music is stored in AppData > play-yan > music. They must be in mp3, wav, or ogg format. You can put songs into folders, but folders inside of folders will not work.

Videos are stored in AppData > play-yan > video. They must be in ogv format. Yeah, this is a weird format that I don't think many people use, but it's the only thing that Love2D supports... sorry! Also, folders will not work here.

# Notice any innacuracies?
If you find something that is not the same as how it is on the original Play-Yan, please let me know in the issues tab! I do not own a Play-Yan myself, so I only have the few videos I could find online about this media player as a reference.
